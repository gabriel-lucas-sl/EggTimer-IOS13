# Egg Timer

This is little project that I developed in the eight section of Angela Yu's IOS development <a href="https://www.udemy.com/course/ios-13-app-development-bootcamp/" target="_blank">course</a>. The goal of this tutorial is to be able to resolve a mix of challenges and get comfortable with looking up how to do something that I've may never done before.
